# Mongooese Node Js Skeleton

A mongoose app built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/) .

# Features

  <li>Uses Express as the application Framework.</li> 
  <li>Uses MongoDB, Mongoose  for storing data.</li>
  <li>Uses RESTful Web Service for serve different platforms</li> 
   
The app demonstrates how decoupling content from its presentation enables greater flexibility and facilitates shipping higher quality software more quickly.

## Requirements

- Node 16.16.0
- Git
- npm 8.11.0

### Running Locally

Make sure you have Node.js and npm install.

1. Clone or Download the repository

2. Install Dependencies

3. MongoDB start for need <pre>mongod</pre>command from a different terminal.

4. Start the Application
      <pre>npm run start</pre>
   Application runs from localhost:4033.

## How It Works

A database called "mongoose-node-skelton" named is created via code.


## Steps for read-only access

To start the express server, run the following

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:4033](http://localhost:4033) and take a look around.

## RESTful

Using HTTP requests, we can use the respective action to trigger every of these four CRUD operations.  
 <li>POST is used to send data to a server — Create</li>
<li>GET is used to fetch data from a server — Read</li>
<li>PUT is used to send and update data — Update</li>
<li>DELETE is used to delete data — Delete </li>
